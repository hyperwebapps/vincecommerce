# Hi, I'm Vincenzo ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack web developer, with great experience in Typescript and Java.

## Projects I worked on

- API from scratch Java(Dropwizard, Hibernate)
- API from scratch with Typescript(Nest Js)
- Dashboards with custom components with Vue Js
- Blog with Next Js, Material Ui, Firebase
- Smart Contracts with Solidity and Open Zeppelin
- Web3 app with React, Metamask (Wallet), Fluent Ui
- API maintaining with Java(Dropwizard) and Oracle Db in clusters with Kubernetes

## Why you should choose me

1. Results-oriented: My goal is to deliver high-quality code that is easy to maintain and reuse.
2. Team mindset: I work well alone and in groups, and I tend to lead because I want to deliver the best results and help others become their best selves.
3. Not only code-oriented: I understand that to create something bigger, I need a complete vision, not only from a technical aspect but also from a logical aspect.

I can help you if:
- you need someone who is fast and professional
- you want someone who is able to understand the complete vision of projects
- you want someone who is constantly up-to-date with technologies and business aspects
- the project is very challenging
- you want someone who is a very good team player, able to help other developers and able to learn from them too
